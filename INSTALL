The sources can be compiled with Borland Turbo Assembler.

I have not found a free assembler that could compile the sources yet (NASM
does not support the ASSUME directive and YASM does not support the TASM
syntax). I intend to rewrite the simulator from scratch, which will
make this point mute, compiled binaries are available until then.
