The files in this directory are copies of software for PMD 85 originally
distributed on compact casettes. At the time, there were no elaborate
licensing policies in place, the legal protection of the software
was derived from authorship. To the best of my knowledge, the
authors of the files in this directory gave permission
for the software to be copied and used freely.

The files in this directory also contain copies of bootstrap software
originally hardwired inside PMD 85. Lacking any information to indicate
otherwise, I believe there is no harm in distributing these files as well.

The question of rights related to software written some twenty years ago in
a state that did not exactly go to great pains in protecting intellectual
property are difficult to solve. Since this project is about the fun of
reviving an otherwise useless platform to make a few nostalgic hobbyists
remember the good old days :-) I guess no harm is done here. But do let me
know should you feel your rights are violated and I will do my best to fix it.
